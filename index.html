  <h2>Codehub is organised by:</h2>

  <p>Gicela: I’ve been developing for the web since the mid 1990’s and have never stopped learning. I feel we need to create a hub of learners where we can share knowledge, help each other and create an environment where we feel comfortable learning.</p>

  <p>Katja: I have been fascinated by the web since uploading my first html file in 2000 and creating a personal website. I have now been developing for the web professionally for over 5 years. I too keep learning new things all the time and I’m loving it. The only thing is that working and learning from home can become a bit solitary, and for long stretches there is no feedback. So teaming up with others in a similar situation seems a good idea!</p>
